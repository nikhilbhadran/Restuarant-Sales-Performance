# Restuarant-Sales-Performance-Dashboard

I am sharing a pizza restaurant Sales Performance Analysis - performed on Power BI & SQL.

# About Project üë®‚Äçüíª

Developed ETL mappings using SQL to extract the data from unstructured data and transformed it to the staging area to conduct data cleaning on Power BI.

Developed a Power BI dashboard to perform analysis, producing quantitative visualizations to draw valuable insights based on different parameters affecting the restaurant's performance year on year and further provide business solutions.

# Data Analysis Using SQL
PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES
KPI‚Äôs

1. Total Revenue:
`SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;`

2. Average Order Value
`SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales`

3. Total Pizzas Sold
`SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales`
 
4. Total Orders
`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales`
 
5. Average Pizzas Per Order
`SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2))
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales`
 
6. Daily Trend for Total Orders
`SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date)`
 
7. Monthly Trend for Orders
`SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) as Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as Total_Orders
from pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date)Output`

8. % of Sales by Pizza Category
`SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category`

9. of Sales by Pizza Size
`SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY pizza_size`

10. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
`SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) as Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2
GROUP BY pizza_category
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC`

11. Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC`
 
12. Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC`
 
13. Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC`
 
14. Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity
`SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC`

15. Top 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC`
 
16. Borrom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC`

17. To apply the pizza_category or pizza_size filters to the above queries we can use WHERE clause. Examples :-
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE pizza_category = 'Classic'
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC`
